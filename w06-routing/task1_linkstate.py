"""Week 6 · Task 1 — Link state: build the forwarding table yourself.

Textbook §5.2 (link state and distance vector) and §5.3 (OSPF).

Every OSPF router ends up holding the same map of the network, and then each one
computes, alone, where to send a packet for every destination. The computation is
Dijkstra; the output is a forwarding table with **one next hop per destination**,
not a path.

That last part is what makes routing work without anybody carrying a route around
in the packet. Build it.
